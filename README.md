# Face Recognition and Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a face recognition and specific face detection system developed from scratch. Utilizing PyTorch and Python, this project employs advanced techniques such as triplet loss to effectively train robust models capable of recognizing and detecting faces accurately.

## Project Overview

The "Face Recognition and Detection" project aims to develop a highly accurate system that not only recognizes faces from a dataset but also detects specific faces in real-time. By implementing triplet loss, the model enhances its capability to differentiate between distinct faces more effectively, making it ideal for applications requiring high security or personalized interactions.

## Features

- **Face Recognition**: Identify individuals from a database of known faces.
- **Specific Face Detection**: Detect and highlight faces in real-time video streams or images.
- **Triplet Loss Implementation**: Utilizes triplet loss for training the model, ensuring high accuracy and efficient learning.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized into multiple scripts for ease of testing and scalability.
